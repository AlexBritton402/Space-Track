# Satellite Tracker

This is a full-stack Cesium + Flask satellite tracking app that:
- Lets users place a marker on Earth
- Calculates all visible satellites from that point using Space-Track data
- Shows live orbits using CesiumJS

## Deployment
- Frontend: Upload `/frontend` to a static site (Render or Vercel)
- Backend: Deploy `/backend` as a Flask web service on Render
